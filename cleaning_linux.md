To clean up your Arch Linux installation and remove all packages installed via pacman or yay (excluding essential packages like linux, base, and base-devel), follow these steps:
1. List All Installed Packages

First, list all installed packages to identify what’s installed and what you want to keep:

bash

pacman -Qq

2. Filter Packages to Remove

You’ll need to create a list of packages that should be removed, excluding essential packages. Use the following commands to help with this:

    List explicitly installed packages (excluding dependencies):

    bash

pacman -Qe

List all installed packages:

bash

pacman -Qq

Create a list of packages to exclude (e.g., linux, base, base-devel, and other essential packages):

bash

    echo -e "linux\nbase\nbase-devel" > /tmp/exclude.txt

3. Remove Unwanted Packages

    Generate a list of packages to remove:

    bash

pacman -Qq | grep -v -F -f /tmp/exclude.txt > /tmp/to_remove.txt

This command excludes the packages listed in /tmp/exclude.txt from the list of all installed packages.

Review the list:

bash

cat /tmp/to_remove.txt

Make sure it only includes packages you want to remove.

Remove the packages:

bash

    sudo pacman -Rns - < /tmp/to_remove.txt

    This command will remove all the packages listed in /tmp/to_remove.txt, including their dependencies.

4. Clean Up Orphaned Packages

After removing packages, you might have orphaned packages (dependencies no longer required). Clean them up with:

bash

sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq)

5. Remove AUR Packages

For packages installed via yay, you can list and remove them:

    List all AUR packages installed via yay:

    bash

yay -Qq | grep -v -F -f /tmp/exclude.txt > /tmp/aur_to_remove.txt

Review the list:

bash

cat /tmp/aur_to_remove.txt

Remove the AUR packages:

bash

    yay -Rns - < /tmp/aur_to_remove.txt

6. Clean Package Cache

Finally, clean up the package cache to free up disk space:

bash

sudo pacman -Sc

Summary of Steps:

    List all installed packages.
    Exclude essential packages from the list.
    Remove unwanted packages.
    Clean up orphaned packages.
    Remove AUR packages.
    Clean package cache.

Make sure to carefully review the lists of packages to remove to avoid accidentally deleting important ones. Let me know if you need further help!

To reset your Arch Linux system to a fresh state by removing temporary files and unnecessary data, follow these steps:
1. Remove Package Cache

Clear out the package cache to free up space:

bash

sudo pacman -Scc

You'll be prompted to confirm the removal of all cached packages. Confirm as needed.
2. Remove Orphaned Packages

Clean up orphaned packages that are no longer required:

bash

sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq)

3. Remove User Cache and Temporary Files

Remove temporary files and cache for all users:

bash

sudo rm -rf /tmp/*
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/*

Clear user cache:

bash

rm -rf ~/.cache/*

4. Clear Log Files

Logs can accumulate and take up space. Clear the system log files:

bash

sudo rm -rf /var/log/*

You may also want to clear journal logs if you're using systemd:

bash

sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s

5. Reset User Configuration

If you want to reset user-specific settings and configurations, you can back up and then remove configuration directories:

bash

mv ~/.config ~/.config_backup
mv ~/.local ~/.local_backup
mv ~/.cache ~/.cache_backup

Be cautious with this step as it will remove all user-specific settings.
6. Remove AUR Packages

If you want to remove all AUR packages installed via yay, list and remove them:

    List all AUR packages:

    bash

yay -Qq | grep -v -F -f /tmp/exclude.txt > /tmp/aur_to_remove.txt

Remove AUR packages:

bash

    yay -Rns - < /tmp/aur_to_remove.txt

7. Check for Residual Files

Some applications might leave residual files in /usr/local, /opt, or /var. Check and clean up these directories if needed.
8. Reinstall Essential Packages

If you want to ensure that the essential packages are correctly installed:

bash

sudo pacman -S base base-devel linux

Summary of Steps:

    Clear package cache: sudo pacman -Scc
    Remove orphaned packages: sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq)
    Remove temporary files: sudo rm -rf /tmp/* /var/tmp/* and rm -rf ~/.cache/*
    Clear log files: sudo rm -rf /var/log/* and sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s
    Reset user configuration: Backup and remove user configuration directories
    Remove AUR packages: Use yay commands to list and remove
    Check for residual files: Clean up directories if needed
    Reinstall essential packages: Ensure base, base-devel, and linux are installed

These steps will help you achieve a "reset" state for your Arch Linux system by removing unnecessary files and reverting configurations. Let me know if you need further assistance!



Resetting Arch Linux to a "just installed" state can be quite involved. Unlike some operating systems, Arch Linux does not have a straightforward "factory reset" option. However, you can achieve a similar result by removing most of the installed packages, clearing configuration files, and resetting the system to a minimal state. Below are the steps to do this:
1. Backup Important Data

Before proceeding, ensure you have backed up any important data. This process will remove packages and configurations, potentially leading to data loss.
2. Remove All Installed Packages

You can remove all packages installed by pacman except for essential base packages like linux, base, and base-devel. Use the following commands:

sh

sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qqdt)

This command will remove all orphaned packages, which are packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed.

Next, remove all non-essential packages:

sh

sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qqe | grep -vx "$(pacman -Qqg base-devel) $(pacman -Qqg base) linux")

This will remove all packages except those in the base, base-devel, and linux groups.
3. Remove User Configuration Files

You can remove user-specific configuration files to reset your environment settings:

sh

rm -rf ~/.config ~/.local ~/.cache ~/.Xresources ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.zprofile ~/.xinitrc

If you want to reset the system-wide configuration files:

sh

sudo rm -rf /etc/*

This step is extreme, and be cautious, as it will remove all system-wide configuration files, potentially breaking the system.
4. Clear Package Cache

Clear the pacman cache to free up space and remove cached packages:

sh

sudo pacman -Scc

5. Reinstall Base System

Reinstall the base system to ensure all necessary components are correctly installed:

sh

sudo pacman -S base base-devel linux linux-firmware

6. Reboot

Finally, reboot your system:

sh

sudo reboot

7. Reconfigure Your System

After rebooting, you will need to reconfigure your system, such as setting up the bootloader, networking, users, etc., as if it were a fresh installation.
